Credit Card Validation

An Erlang module for testing credit card numbers.

To run the tests use `make test`

The main.escript simply takes a list of credit card numbers as
arguments and outputs the results of the checks.

The credit card module exports two functions:
  is_valid/1
    This takes the credit card number as a string and returns
    true or false depending on the number's validity.
    
  type/1
    This takes the credit card number as a string and returns
    an atom describing the credit card's type.
    Possible values are: visa, mastercard, amex, discover and unknown.
